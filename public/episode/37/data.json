{"episode37":{"changed":true,"id":37,"name":"37   Tourney Discussion, Qualls/Portis talk, and Diamond Hogs","description":"We touch on the 2015 NCAA tourney, the Qualls/Portis decision and make predictions there. We also touch on the diamond hogs for very briefly for the first time this season and all while saving some time for throwing shade at Calipari.","link":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/thehogcast/hogcast37.mp3","summary":"In this episode, the crew breaks down a truly memorable NCAA  Tournament. Is it the greatest one ever? Let's just say that it was  definitely asked, and not sarcastically. Then the crew turns their  focus back to Fayetteville and go on the record as to whether Bobby  Portis and Michael Qualls will return to school. Then the guys resort  to one of their favorite pastimes: Shading Kentucky head coach John  Calipari out. Arkansas baseball took a series from Ole Miss, is it a  turning point? Then Logan (of all people) breaks some recruiting news  at the end of the show. As always, thanks for listening.","publishDate":"2015-03-30T01:26:40.000Z","duration":"54:00","keywords":"Arkansas, SEC, Basketball, Bball, Razorbacks, The Hog Cast, Calipari, Kentucky, Baseball","imageLink":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/thehogcast/profilePicture.png"}}
