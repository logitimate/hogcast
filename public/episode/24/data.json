Was this already one of Arkansas's biggest tests away from  home during the league schedule? How were the Hogs able to dig out of  a 13-point first-half deficit to win? Is it good to ride the hot hand  as much as the Hogs do? Then Logan and Colby interview the Froholdt  Brothers (Hjalte and Lars), who were gracious enough to  come onto the show. Then the guys talk about the SEC's bowl record  and the comings and goings with the football staff.","publishDate":"2015-01-06T01:26:40.000Z","duration":"55:15","keywords":"Arkansas, WPS, SEC, Razorbacks, Arkansas Razorbacks, Georgia Bulldogs,UGA, Georgia, The Hog Cast, Hogs, Froholdt, Hjalte Froholdt","imageLink":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/thehogcast/profilePicture.png"}}
